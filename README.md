# airbnb_seattle_data_analysis
Analysis of Seattle Airbnb data. The analysis tries to understand how various features of the Airbnb listings affect their prices.

The questions that I aim to answer are:-

Question 1: Does the neighbourhood affect the price?
Question 2: Does the room type influence the price?
Question 3: Does the host response time have an impact on the price?


### Libraries used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

### Files included
- Airbnb_Data_Analysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with the code analysisng the dataset
- data/calendar.csv - CSV file containg airbnb data about availability of listings as wells as pricing
- data/listings.csv - CSV file containg airbnb data about listings such as beds, bedrooms, bathrooms etc

### Summary
From the analysis we find that some features in the dataset such as neighbourhood, room type, bedrooms, bathrooms do influence the pricing of the listings. We also found that other features such as host response time had no impact on the listing price.
